<title>Random Walk Exercises</title>
 
	<p>
		For each HW problem, include a well-labelled plot that shows the shapes and the points selected through the Random Walk process.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<p>
				1d Random Walk (coin flip)
			</p>
			<p>
				Create a random walk based on a coin flip in the following way.  Start at the origin.  Flip a fair coin.  If it comes up heads, draw a line from the origin to (1,1) and if tails to (1,-1).  Repeat the process so that at each stage you are drawing a line from the previous point to the point given by (iteration \#, (previous y-coordinate) <m>\pm 1</m>).  For example, if the run was HHHTH, you would have drawn from the origin to the points:
				<me> (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,2), (5,3).</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				Write your code to run for 100 steps.  The output should be the plot of the path, markers at the points where the path crosses the zero line (i.e. the x-axis) along with statements about the number of times the zero line is crossed and the final position of the path.  The statements should appear somewhere in the figure window.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where do you think the path should end up?  Explain.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Biased 1d Random Walk (weighted coin)
			</p>
			<p>
				Redo the code from problem 1 except instead of using a fair coin assume that heads appears 60% of the time.  Now, run the simulation a large number of times (say 500 or so and each for 100 steps) and find the average distance away from the zero line for all of the trials.  (Hint: It would be wise to have a nested loop).
			</p>
			<p>
				You do not need to include a plot in this problem, but it may help you visually confirm the information as you work through the steps.
			</p>
			<p>
				What do you think the average distance away from the zero line should be?  Explain.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				Biased 1d Random Walk, general case 
			</p>
			<p>
				Repeat the previous problem, but assume that the probability of getting a heads is P, what should the average distance away from the zero line be over a large number of trials?
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				2d Random Walk
			</p>
			<p>
				Create a 2-dimensional random walk in the following way.  Start at the origin.  Randomly pick one of four numbers (say 1,2,3,4).  Draw a line up one unit if the number is 1, right one unit if it is 2, down one unit if it is 3 and left one unit if it is 4.
			</p>
			<p>
				Repeat the process so that at each stage you are drawing a unit line segment from the previous point either up, right, down or left. For example, if the run was 1443231, you would have drawn from the origin to the points:

				<me>(0,1), (-1,1), (-2,1), (-2,0), (-1,0), (-1,-1), (-1,1).</me>
				
				Write your code to run for 10,000 steps.  The output should be the plot of the path along with statements about the number of times the origin is revisited, the final position of the path and the furthest away from the origin the path travels.  The statements should appear somewhere in the figure window.
			</p>
			<p>
				Extra Credit 1: Make the path color coded so that as you move along the path the color slowly changes.
			</p>
			<p>
				Extra Credit 2: If you run the path for N steps (instead of 10,000) how far away from the origin do you end up on average?  See if you can come up with a formula for the distance from the origin in terms of N.  You might have to run your path several times to see a pattern.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				2d Random Walk with Diagonals
			</p>
			<p>
				Repeat the previous problem, except allow for 8 directions:N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) chosen from a uniform distribution.  In the cases where you move diagonally, you can either move one unit or to the next grid point (e.g. right one, up one for NE).
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				3d Random Walk
				Create a random walk using 6 spatial directions using (x,y,z)-coordinates.  For the plot, you might want to use the view command or else you'll have to rotate to 3d after the plot is made.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				2d Levy Flight
			</p>
			<p>
				Create a 2-dimensional Levy Flight in the following way.  Start at the origin.  Randomly pick a direction (i.e. an angle between 0 and <m>2\pi</m>).
