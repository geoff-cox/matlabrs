<title>Random Walks</title>

	<p>
		This section is about random walks and Levy Flights.  A random walk is a probabilistic path taken along a straight line, in the plane, or in space.  Starting at a given point, you move one step in a random direction.
	</p>

	<p>
		In 1d, you can move up or down, in 2d, up, down, left, or right and in 3d, up, down, left, right, in, or out. Repeating this process will give you the path.  Note that the walk may also be weighted, meaning that random process may not be from a uniform distribution.
	</p>

	<p>
		A Levy Flight is similar to a random walk, except that the distance travelled on each step is determined by a Levy Distribution.
