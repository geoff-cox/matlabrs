<title>Monte Carlo Methods</title>

	<p>
		The Monte Carlo method has many applications, but here you will use it to compute areas of geometric figures.   The results will be compared against values obtained through symbolic and numeric integration.

	</p>

	<p>
		The idea of the Monte Carlo method for finding area is straight forward.   If you wish to find the area of a region <m>R_1</m>, first choose a second region, <m>R_2</m> that contains <m>R_1</m> and has a known area.  The easiest selection for <m>R_2</m> is a square.  Then randomly select points inside <m>R_2</m> (uniformly).  Some of the points will fall in <m>R_1</m> and some will fall in <m>R_2\backslash R_1</m> (set minus).  When the area of <m>R_2</m> is multiplied by the ratio of the points in <m>R_1</m> to the total number of points, you will have an approximation to the area of the region <m>R_1</m>.  

	</p>

	<p>
		In MATLAB, you will have to plot the figures and include descriptive statements.  You will also have to figure out how to determine if a point is inside the figure or not.

	</p>

	<p>
		In the following problems, use the Monte Carlo method with a large but reasonable number of sample points. Make sure the values of the area(s) are given in the plots somewhere.
