<title>Image Editor</title>

	<p>
		For this problem, you need to create a Graphical User Interface to manipulate a set of pre-loaded images.
	</p>

	<!-- %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% -->

	<ol>
		<li>
			Create a popup menu that allows the user to select the image to manipulate. You should give the user at least 4 images to select from.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create two button that flips the current image, one horizontally and one vertically.
		</li>
		<li>
			Create a button that rotated the current image by 90 degrees. Note if you press this button 2x, the image should be upside down. If you press this button 4 times it should be in its original position.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add a slider button for each pixel type that can be used to increase/decrease the value of that color pixel.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add a button to revert the image to its original form.
		</li>
		<li>
			Think of 2 other functions that this GUI could perform. Add these function to your GUI. Be sure to select an appropriate button type.
