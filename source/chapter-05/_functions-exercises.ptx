				Consider a triangle <m>ABC</m>.  Suppose the length of the sides <m>AB</m> and <m>AC</m> are 3 and 4, resp.  Let <m>\theta</m> denote the angle at the vertex <m>A</m>.  Use the law of cosines to create a table with two columns: the first column containing <m>\theta</m> in increments of 10 degrees from 0 to 180 degrees and the second column containing the length of the side <m>BC</m>.  First define the variables <m>AB, AC</m> and <m>\theta</m> and then define <m>BC</m> in terms of them.
				What is the average length of <m>BC</m> for <m>\theta</m> between 20 and 150 degrees?

				Two blocks of masses <m>m_1</m> and <m>m_2</m> are connected by a string over a smooth pulley as shown.  Assume that <m>m_2&gt;m_1</m>.  If the coefficient of friction is <m>\mu</m> and <m>r=m_1/m_2</m>, then the masses will move at a constant speed (<m>m_2</m> slides down the slope) if the angle <m>\theta</m> is given by

				<me>
					\cos(\theta) = \frac{-\mu r + \sqrt{1-r^2+\mu^2}}{1+\mu^2}

				Write a file that will convert a given number of seconds into years, days, hours, minutes and seconds. Use this file to give the conversion for 1,000 seconds, 1,000,000 seconds and 1,000,000,000 seconds. These commands may help <c>fix</c>, <c>floor</c>, <c>mod</c>, and <c>rem</c>.

				For a continuous money stream, we have the equation <m>F=P e^{rt}</m> where <m>F</m> is final value, <m>r</m> is the interest rate, <m>P</m> is the principal, and <m>t</m> is time.  Use the <c>meshgrid</c> and the <c>exp</c> commands to find possible values of <m>F</m> for <m>P</m> ranging from <m>10,000</m> to <m>50,000</m> (in increments of <m>10,000</m>) and <m>t</m> ranging from 0 to 10 (in increments of 1).  You can select the value of <m>r</m>, but use a reasonable, real-world interest rate (explain how you chose your value of <m>r</m> too).

				A uniform beam is freely hinged at its ends <m>x = 0</m> and <m>x = L</m>, so that the ends are at the same level.  It carries a uniformly distributed load of <m>W</m> per unit length and there is a tension <m>T</m> along the <m>x</m>-axis.  The deflection <m>y</m> of the beam a distance <m>x</m> from on end is given by
				<me>
					y = \frac{W \cdot EI}{T^2}
					\left[ 
					\frac{\cosh\left[ a (L/2 - x)\right]}{\cosh(a\, L/2)} - 1 
					\right] + \frac{W x(L-x)}{2T}
				</me>
				where <m>a^2= T/EI</m> , <m>E</m> is Young's Modulus of the beam and <m>I</m> is the moment of inertia of a cross-section of a beam.  If the beam is <m>10 m</m> long, the tension is <m>1000N</m>, the load <m>100 N/m</m> and <m>EI</m> is <m>10^4</m>, make a table of <m>x</m> versus <m>y</m> where <m>x</m> ranges from 0 to 10 in increments of <m>1 m</m>.  Make sure to define the variables <m>a, W, EI, T</m> and <m>x</m> and then define <m>y</m> in terms of them.

		When you submit this assignment, there should be seven separate files.  Problems 1-6 should be in their own function m-files, properly commented.  Problem 7 should be a separate script m-file that uses the code from the first 6 problems.

				<me>
					f(t) = -\frac{9.8}{2} t^2 + 147 t + 500, \quad t>0

				Create an appropriately named conversion function that has one input (<c>dollars</c>) and one output (<c>ConversionTable</c>).  The output conversion table should contain four columns, with <c>dollars</c> in the first column and the conversions into Yen, Euros, and British Pounds in the next three columns.

				Create a function called <c>plotlines</c> with two inputs and no outputs with the following details.  The first input should be a <m>1 \times 2</m> matrix (representing the base point, B, in the plane).  The second input should be a <m>2 \times 2</m> matrix (representing two more points in the plane, P and Q).  When the function is run, there should be a plot of two line segments, BP and BQ, with the two distances displayed halfway along each line.
