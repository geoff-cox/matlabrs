			<title>MATLAB Basics</title>

			<introduction xml:id="chpt-01-intro">
				<p>
					This chapter introduces the MATLAB computing environment and the basic skills needed to work with it interactively.
				</p>

				<p>
					You will begin by installing MATLAB and becoming familiar with the MATLAB Desktop, including the Command Window, Workspace, and Editor. You will then learn how to use the Command Window as a calculator, how MATLAB evaluates commands, and how results are stored in memory.			
				</p>

				<p>
					The chapter concludes with an introduction to variables—how they are created, named, and reused. Understanding how MATLAB stores values and executes assignments is essential before moving on to writing scripts and programs, which will be the focus of the next chapter.

				<objectives>
					<ol>
						<li>The Command Window functions as a command-line interface embedded within MATLAB's graphical environment.</li>
						<li>MATLAB stores all defined variables in memory in a location called the workspace.</li>
						<li>The assignment operator <c>=</c> tells MATLAB to evaluate an expression and store its value under a variable name; it does not represent a mathematical equation.</li>
						<li>Variables store numerical values, not formulas, and changing one variable does not automatically update values that were computed earlier.</li>
						<li>Ending a command with a semicolon suppresses output but does not affect how values are stored.</li>
						<li>Commands such as <pf>clear</pf>, <pf>clc</pf>, and <pf>format</pf> help manage the workspace and Command Window during an interactive session.</li>
						<li>MATLAB imposes specific rules on variable names, and clear, descriptive names make code easier to read and debug.</li>
