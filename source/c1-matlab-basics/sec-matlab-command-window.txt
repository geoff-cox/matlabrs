  <title>Command Window</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			Software applications require a way for users to interact with them.
			This interaction occurs through a <term>User Interface</term> (UI).
		</p>

		<p>
			Most applications use one or both of the following interface styles:
			<dl>
				<li>
					<title>Command Line Interface (CLI)</title>
					<p>
						Users type commands at a prompt to control the application.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<title>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</title>
					<p>
						Users interact through visual elements such as buttons, menus, and windows.
					</p>
				</li>
			</dl>
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's pratice using MATLAB's CLI with some simple examples.
		</p>

		<p>
			MATLAB is unusual in that it provides a CLI directly inside its GUI.
			This embedded CLI is called the <xref ref="command-window" text="custom">Command Window</xref>.

    <title>Basic Calculations</title>

    <p>
      You can use the Command Window as a calculator by entering expressions
      and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
    </p>

    <program language="matlab">
      <code>
        2 + 3
      </code>
    </program>

    <p>
      MATLAB displays the result using the default variable name <pf>ans</pf>.
    </p>

    <pre>
ans =
     5
    </pre>

    <p>
      MATLAB also includes built-in mathematical constants and functions.
    </p>

    <program language="matlab">
      <code>

        sin(pi/2)

          When you enter an expression without assigning it to a variable,
          how does MATLAB store the result?

			<title>Common Beginner Mistakes</title>

			<p>
				When first using MATLAB, it is common to encounter confusing results due to a few
				predictable mistakes.
				<ul>
					<li>
						Forgetting that MATLAB executes commands in the order they are run, not the order
						they appear on the screen.
					</li>
					<li>
						Assuming MATLAB automatically updates previously computed values when a variable changes.
					</li>
					<li>
						Leaving old variables in the workspace and unintentionally reusing them.
					</li>
					<li>
						Interpreting the symbol <c>=</c> as a mathematical equation rather than an assignment.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				Nearly all of these issues can be resolved by clearing the workspace and re-running
				commands in a logical order.

		<title>Keeping the Command Window Organized</title>

		<p>
			As you work in the Command Window, MATLAB keeps a history of commands, output,
			and variables. Several built-in commands help you keep your workspace organized.
		</p>

		<program language="matlab">
			<code>
				clear
				clc
				format short
			</code>
		</program>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<pf>clear</pf> removes all variables from the workspace.
			</li>
			<li>
				<pf>clc</pf> clears the Command Window display.
			</li>
			<li>
				<pf>format</pf> controls how numerical output is displayed (but not how it is stored).
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			These commands do not undo work permanently, but they do reset your current session.
			When results seem confusing, using <pf>clear</pf> and starting fresh is often helpful.
		</p>
