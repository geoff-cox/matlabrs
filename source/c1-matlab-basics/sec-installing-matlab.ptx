  <p>
    MATLAB is a professional computing environment developed by MathWorks.
    Before you can begin using it, you must install MATLAB on your computer
    using a licensed MathWorks account.
  </p>

  <p>
    The current version of MATLAB is <em>R2025b</em>.
    The steps below describe a typical installation process.
    Screens and options may vary slightly depending on your operating system.
