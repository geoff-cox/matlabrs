    <p>
      MATLAB is more than a calculator. It is a full computing environment designed
      to help you explore mathematics, write programs, and manage data.
      To use MATLAB effectively, it is important to understand the main parts of
      the MATLAB Desktop.

    <title>Main Components</title>

    <p>
      When MATLAB opens, the screen is divided into panels.
      Each panel has a specific role in how you interact with MATLAB.
      Although the layout can be customized, the following components are essential.
			<dl width="narrow">
				<li>
					<title>Files</title>
					<p>
						Shows the current working directory.
						Files you create or save are placed here by default.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li xml:id="command-window">
					<title>Command Window</title>
					<p>
						The command window is where you enter commands at the prompt <pf>&gt;&gt;</pf>.
						MATLAB evaluates each command when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<title>Workspace</title>
					<p>
						Displays variables currently stored in memory, including their names,
						sizes, and values.
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					<title>Editor</title>
					<p>
						Used to write, edit, and debug MATLAB programs and scripts.
					</p>
				</li>

    <title>Modifying the Layout</title>

    <p>
      The MATLAB Desktop is customizable.
      Panels can be shown, hidden, or rearranged to suit your workflow.
    </p>

		<p>
			The sidebars on the left, right, and bottom of the desktop show the tools that are docked in the desktop.
			<ul>
				<li>Use sidebar icons to show or hide panels.</li>
				<li>Drag panel title bars to reposition them.</li>
				<li>Open additional tools using the <q>Open more panels</q> button.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			So far, we have used MATLAB interactively by entering commands one at a time in the
			Command Window. This approach is useful for quick calculations and experimentation.
		</p>

		<p>
			As problems become more complex, typing commands repeatedly becomes inefficient.
			MATLAB allows you to store sequences of commands in files called <em>scripts</em>,
			which can be edited, saved, and run as a single program.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before learning how to write scripts, we must first understand how MATLAB stores
			information internally. This begins with variables.
