<title>Nearest Neighbor</title>

	<p>
		The second of the four methods for dealing with the TSP is called nearest neighbor (NN).  Again, the goal will be to minimize the distance traveled overall in moving from the home at the origin, to each of the cities and then back home.
	</p>

	<p>
		The nearest neighbor approach is properly named.  At each step you simply move from the city you are located to the nearest city that hasn't been visited.  Repeat until all cities have been visited and then return home. The NN method is very fast, even for a large number of cities.

	<p>
		Here are the details about the brute force function in the assignment:
	</p>

	<p>
		The single input variable is an <m>n \times 2</m> matrix where the rows are the <m>(x,y)</m>-coordinates of the cities.  The output is the length of the shortest path.
	</p>

	<p>
		A plot should show the path and include all appropriate information such as labels for the home and the cities, information about the total path length and order that the cities are visited, code run time, titles, and any other useful text.
