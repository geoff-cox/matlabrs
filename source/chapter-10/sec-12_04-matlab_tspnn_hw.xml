		<li>
			<p>
				Just as for the HW on Brute Force, create Pseudocode for the program.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Actual code</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The actual code should be a function .m file with appropriate comments and header.
				The input is a matrix of the cities in <m>n</m> rows and 2 columns and the output is the length of the shortest path.  Include a well-labelled plot of the shortest path along with descriptive information.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Sample run</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Run your program for a set of 25 cities that are randomly chosen and have coordinates <m>(x,y)</m> with <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> between 0 and 50.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Comparison with brute force</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
		    Run your NN and brute force program from the last assignment on a set of 8 cities that are randomly chosen and have coordinates <m>(x,y)</m> with <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> between 0 and 10.  Compare the results, both for distances and timing.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Bad example</em>
			</p>

			<p>
		    Find an example with 3 cities (so, 4 total with the origin) where NN actually gives the longest path.  This shows the danger of the NN algorithm to solving the problem, as it actually might give the worst solution.
