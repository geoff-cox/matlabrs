		<li>
			<p>
				Just as for the HWs on Brute Force and Nearest Neighbor, create Pseudocode for the program.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Actual code</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				The actual code should be a function .m file with appropriate comments and header.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The five inputs are listed in the description: Cities <m>(nx2 matrix)</m>, initial temperature, cooling rate, number of iterations, initial number of pairs of cities to swap.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The output the length of the final path.
			</p>

			<p>
				A series of plots should appear showing the shortest path at each step along with descriptive information, including the path length.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The final plot should be of the path after the program has run for the desired number of iterations along with descriptive information, including the path length.
			</p>
		</li>

			<p>
				<em>Sample run</em>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			  Run your program for a set of 25 cities that are randomly chosen and have coordinates <m>(x,y)</m> with <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> between 0 and 50.  Make sure to provide the locations of the cities, run time of the program, and the corresponding plots.  Try several sets of starting conditions, but as an example try 20 cities, initial temp of 1, cooling rate of 0.9, 2000 iterations, and 5 initial cities to swap.
