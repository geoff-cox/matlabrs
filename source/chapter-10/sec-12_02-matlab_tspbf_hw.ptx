				<em>Pseudocode</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				Pseudocode is a way to layout the plan of attack on a program and should be used in most programs.  At the base level it can look like a flowchart with arrows (and perhaps loops) to outline the way the program should run.  At a more advanced level a conditional loop might look like the following (with anything between &lt;&gt; being fleshed out in English):
			</p>

			<p>
				For an if loop
			</p>

			<tabular>
				<row>
					<cell colspan="2">if &lt;put conditions that need to be met&gt;</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell/>
					<cell>&lt;do this if the conditions are met&gt;</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell colspan="2">elseif &lt;other conditions&gt;</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell/>
					<cell>&lt;do this if new conditions are met&gt;</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell colspan="2">else</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell/>
					<cell>&lt;otherwise, do this&gt;</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>end</cell>
					<cell/>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		
			<p>
				Or, a for loop might be
			</p>

			<tabular>
				<row>
					<cell colspan="2">for &lt;define counter&gt;</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell/>
					<cell>&lt;follow these instructions each time&gt;</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell>end</cell>
					<cell/>
				</row>
			</tabular>

		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<em>Actual code</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				The actual code should be a function .m file with appropriate comments and header.
			</p>

			<p>
				The input is a matrix of the cities in <m>n</m> rows and 2 columns and output are the lengths of the shortest and longest paths.
			</p>

			<p>
				A figure window should appear with two subplots showing the minimum and maximum length paths along with descriptive information about the plots as described in the instructions.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				A sample run of the program for eight cities randomly chosen with coordinates <m>(x,y)</m> with <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> between 0 and 10.
