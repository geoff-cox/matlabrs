				We have that the population is therefore growing according to the equation <m>P = P_0 e^{kt}</m>.  Taking a logarithm, we can convert this into <m>\ln(P) = \ln(P_0) + kt</m> (i.e. <m>\ln(P)</m> is linear in <m>t</m>).

					<li>
						<p>
							Plot the data with <m>t</m> on the horizontal axis and <m>\ln(P)</m> on the vertical axis.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Use the <c>polyfit</c> and <c>polyval</c> functions to find the slope and intercept and add the regression line to the plot in part {\bf a}.
