	<p>
		In this chapter, we discuss the basics of Matlab.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are many different software packages available.  It's important to understand the different capabilities of each as one software package may be the best tool depending on the task.
		Here, we introduce Matlab, which stands for MATrix LABoratory.  Matlab is cost-effective, easy to learn and blends powerful number crunching capabilities with graphical display.  It is an excellent tool for working with large data sets.
	</p>

	<p>
		Other packages that you may wish to consider, include Mathematica, Maple, Fortran, C, C++, or Java.  In some cases, even a basic TI calculator or Excel is the appropriate tool.
	</p>

	<p>
		Matlab has become the industry standard for use in many fields including Mathematics, Bioinformatics, Finance, and Engineering.  The basic Matlab package includes the core package and Simulink, a platform for modeling dynamic systems.  Matlab can also be enhanced through the addition of "toolboxes" (available from Mathworks) including such topics as Control Systems, Image Processing, Splines and SimBiology.
