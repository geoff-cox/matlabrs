				Compute the following using the correct order of operations

			<ol>
				<li>
					<m>2 - 4*(5^{3-2} + 2*(5+6))</m>
				</li>
				<li>
					<m>2 - \displaystyle \frac{4*5^{3-2}}{2*(5+6)}</m>
				</li>
				<li>
					<m>2 - \displaystyle \frac{4*5^{3-2}}{\frac{2}{5}+6}</m>

			The volume of a truncated pyramid with a square base is given by 
			<md>
			</md> 
			where <m>h</m> is the height, <m>a</m> is the length of one of the sides of the base and <m>b</m> is the length of the sides of one of the top (also a square).  Find the volume if <m>a=5, b=3, h=10</m> by first defining <m>a, b</m> and <m>h</m> as separate variables and then defining <m>V</m> in terms of them.
		</li>
		<li>
			The escape velocity from a planet is given by <m>v~=~\sqrt{\displaystyle\frac{2GM}{R}}</m> where <m>G</m> is the gravitational constant, <m>M</m> is the mass and <m>R</m> is the radius of the planet.  Compute the escape velocity of both earth and the moon using an online source to find the constants.  In each case, first define <m>G,M</m> and <m>R</m> and then define <m>v</m> in terms of them.  Make sure to give the citation of your source.

		<li>
			Stirling's formula for computing the factorial is <m>n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n} \left(\displaystyle \frac{n}{e} \right)^n</m>.  For each of <m>n=1,2,3,\cdots, 20</m>, compute both sides of this approximation.  Hint: Use the <c>factorial</c> command in Matlab.
			Note that is problem will be much easier to do with a loop which we will do later.
		</li>
		<li>
			In considering Stirling's formula, since the numbers grow so quickly in using the factorial, it can be advantageous to use the natural logarithm function.  A related approximation is given by <m>\ln (n!) \approx n \ln n - n</m>.  Compute the difference <m>\ln (n!) -( n \ln n - n)</m> for <m>n = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50</m>.  What is the largest value of <m>n</m> that Matlab will allow in this difference calculation?
			Note that is problem will be much easier to do with a loop which we will do later.
