<title>Tips and Hints</title>

	<p>
		Now that you have done all the hard work of writing functions to accomplish all tasks. You can combine them to create a simulation of a fire spreading.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			<term>Start small.</term> When you first run this simulation, start with only a handful of spaces in your forest (<c>N &lt; 10</c>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<term>Take it step by step.</term> Initially, only look at one time step. Print out all of the variable values. Check that the values are updating correctly.
		</li>
		<li>
			<term>Progress naturally.</term> Don't worry about doing everything all at once.  Focus on a single portion of the spreadingFire function. Make sure that works correctly before moving on.
		</li>
		<li>
			<term>Remove chance. </term> Initially, make most probabilities either 0 or 1. For example, while you are first writing the neighbor spreading functions make <c>probCatch=1</c> and <c>probParty=1</c>.
		</li>
		<li>
			<term>DisplayForest is your friend</term>.  Make sure that everything looks right. For example, check that the fire spreads from one tree to it's neighbors in a way that seems appropriate using the DisplayForest function.
		</li>
	</ol>
